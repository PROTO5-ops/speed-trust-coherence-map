            <span class="section-anchor">Thinking</span>
            <div class="editorial-copy">Over the last few decades, with the advent of digital production, most creative decisions were shaped by conscious <em>scarcity</em>. Time, cost, and execution quality set hard limits on what was physically possible — even as digital tools began to introduce new forms of technical abundance.

            In response, frameworks like <strong>Cheap · Fast · Good</strong> emerged — less as fixed rules of production, and more as disciplines on expectation.

            In the age of synthetic media, those physical limits collapse again — more completely. That is the technical reality we are now confronting.

            Each technological shift creates a new form of abundance, and each abundance requires a new form of creative discipline. Production is now fast, inexpensive, and technically polished by default.

            What replaces scarcity is a quieter problem: abundance without orientation. When everything is technically possible, decisions don’t fail at execution — they fail at <em>judgment</em>.</div>

            <div class="asset-wrap">
                <img src="public/assets/images/evolution_diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing the conceptual shift from the classic Cheap-Fast-Good triangle of scarcity to the Speed-Trust-Coherence triangle of abundance">
                <div class="asset-caption">From disciplined production scarcity to responsible synthetic abundance.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="editorial-copy">In an environment of abundance, three constraints determine whether work actually holds: <strong>Speed, Trust, and Coherence</strong>. These are not trade-offs in the old sense. They are pressures that must be actively held if abundance is to produce meaning instead of noise.

            This is no longer a scarcity triangle. Unlike Cheap · Fast · Good, this map does not show what’s impossible. It shows what requires <em>attention and care</em> when production is abundant.

            We are now in the age of intelligent abundance.</div>
